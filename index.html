            Jeff VanderMeer‚Äôs Annihilation is a science-fiction novel that explores mankind‚Äôs reaction to the unknown. Our
            protagonist, only known as the Biologist, joins an expedition into a peculiar area known as Area X motivated by the
            death of her husband. However, as the expedition continued, it became clear that normal laws of nature do not apply
            here. Despite 11 previous expeditions into Area X, not much is learned about the location other than the fact that it is
            expanding. To add on to the mystery, every member of previous expeditions either dies in the expedition or somehow makes
            it back with no memory of the expedition and dies soon after.

            Explorers gamble with their lives when they enter Area X, a large area within Florida that formed due to unknown
            reasons. There is next to no information about the location available, and due to unknown reasons, means of self defense
            were limited to knives and old fashioned handguns. There are no means of transportation other than traveling on foot,
            and the only equipment they have are those they can carry on their back and what was left behind by previous
            expeditions. Expedition members kept journals in which they recorded their finds and their thoughts, strangely though,
            there has been no record or mentions of past journals and the lack of information seems to suggest secrets not just
            within Area X, but with humanity itself.

            The opening chapters of Annihilation throws the reader into the eyes of the Biologist, who is determined to find out
            about the truth about her husband, signs up and joins to become a member of the 12th expedition. Despite being members
            of the same expedition, however, the biologist knows very little about the others. They were kept from each other during
            training and names were never revealed throughout the book, people were referred to as their roles. The biologist, the
            surveyor, the anthropologist, the psychologist and the linguist together make up the 12th expedition. However, according
            to the biologist, the linguist had disappeared prior to the start of the expedition and was never found.

            Throughout Annihilation, the idea of manipulation is constantly shown throughout the story. The whole entire story feels
            like a mind game as we go through the point of view of the Biologist. Even the selection of jobs for the characters,
            specifically the psychologist, foreshadows the ideas surrounding psychology such as: emotions, thoughts, and control.
            Methods of psychological control and manipulation are often repeated. This places a large emphasis on the idea how not
            only one‚Äôs strength is important in this twisted and warped domain but also their sanity and mental capabilities.

            Annihilation has a focal point on the idea of mystery. Oftentimes, both the reader and the protagonist are completely
            oblivious to the true nature of the world. As the plot progresses, the ratio of questions to answers becomes
            increasingly lopsided. Vandermeer rarely provides any explanations and leaves it up to the reader‚Äôs discretion. This
            feeling of being left in the dark perfectly imitates the feeling that the Biologist feels in this strange environment.
            VanderMeer deliberately implements this to build suspense, and to keep the reader engaged. However, the huge lack of
            information tends to backfire and it becomes difficult to keep up.


        </p>
        <p>
            Annihilation is overall a great novel which takes the reader on an odyssey of extraordinary lengths. A contrast of past
            and presence, reading this book will make you twist and turn with every secret uncovered. The lack of definite answers
            and hazy clues in the story creates a situation where readers must reread the story closely to get closer to the truth
            of the world within the book. From the sheer height of depth found inside the characters and setting. Every page
            contains new questions and ideas, which makes reading the book volatile and interesting. However, Annihilation lacks
            coherent plot and character development, leaving most up to reader speculation. The other characters were generic foil
            characters as their main purpose was to quickly advance the plot or to highlight the contrasts between fantasy and
            realism.
